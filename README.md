# Fire Multi Label Classification (FmC)

> Forest Conservation Solutions through Monitoring The Presence of Fire and Smoke with an Image Classification System

## üöÄ Overview

Forest fires are one of the major threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, and the environment. The (FmC) **Fire Multi-label Classification** project offers an intelligent solution that utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to detect and classify the presence of fire, smoke, or normal forest conditions in images. This approach supports forest conservation efforts with faster response times and reduces the risk of uncontrolled fires.

## üéØ Objectives

- Providing early detection system of smoke and fire to support forest conservation.
- Building CNN model for forest image classification in fire, smoke, and normal categories.
- Implementing classification system on monitoring device for real-time detection.

## üìä Dataset

The project using data that from kaggle platform with as follow information:

## üß† Learned

- Implemented a CNN architecture to classify forest imagery into multiple risk levels (fire, smoke, safe).
- Handled image preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation effectively.
- Understood the importance of labeled visual data in environmental monitoring applications.
- Utilized GitHub and Colab for streamlined development, versioning, and experimentation.

## üå± Future Work

- Integrate the system with real-time video feeds from drones or CCTV for proactive forest surveillance.
- Deploy the model on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for on-site monitoring.
- Expand dataset diversity with weather variations, different vegetation types, and nighttime detection.
- Add alert mechanisms (e.g., SMS, Telegram) for instant notifications when fire or smoke is detected.
